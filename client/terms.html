          <li>A compatible Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby)</li>
          <li>Sufficient USDC on the Base network to pay entry fees</li>
          <li>Sufficient ETH on the Base network to pay transaction gas fees</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How RPS Arena Works</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Game Overview</h3>
        <p>RPS Arena is a skill-based competitive game where three players compete in real-time. Each player is assigned a role (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and must use movement strategy to eliminate opponents or collect objectives to win.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Entry Fee and Prize Pool</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Entry Fee:</strong> 1 USDC per match</li>
          <li><strong>Total Prize Pool:</strong> 3 USDC (from 3 players)</li>
          <li><strong>Winner Payout:</strong> 2.4 USDC</li>
          <li><strong>Platform Fee:</strong> 0.6 USDC (20% of prize pool)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Match Rules</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Three players join a lobby, each paying a 1 USDC entry fee</li>
          <li>Each player is randomly assigned a role: Rock, Paper, or Scissors</li>
          <li>Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock</li>
          <li>Players move around the arena and collide with opponents to eliminate them</li>
          <li>If two players remain, the game enters "Showdown Mode" where players race to collect hearts</li>
          <li>The last player standing (or first to collect 2 hearts in Showdown) wins</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.4 Skill-Based Competition</h3>
        <p>RPS Arena is a game of skill. While initial role assignment is random, the outcome depends on player movement, positioning, strategy, and reaction time. Success requires understanding game mechanics, anticipating opponent movements, and making strategic decisions in real-time.</p>

        <h2>3. Payments and Refunds</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Entry Fee Payment</h3>
        <p>When you join a lobby, you authorize a payment of 1 USDC from your connected wallet. This transaction occurs on the Base blockchain and is subject to network gas fees (paid in ETH).</p>

        <h3>3.2 Refund Policy</h3>
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Refund Conditions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lobby timeout:</strong> If a lobby does not fill with 3 players within 30 minutes, you may request a full refund of your 1 USDC entry fee</li>
            <li><strong>No refunds after match start:</strong> Once a match begins (3-player lobby is full and countdown starts), entry fees are non-refundable</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnection:</strong> If you disconnect during a match, you forfeit your entry fee and any potential winnings</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>3.3 Prize Distribution</h3>
        <p>Prizes are distributed automatically to the winner's connected wallet address upon match completion. Prize payouts are final and processed on the Base blockchain.</p>

        <h3>3.4 Transaction Finality</h3>
        <p>All transactions on the Base blockchain are final and irreversible. We cannot reverse, cancel, or modify any blockchain transaction. Double-check your wallet connection before joining a lobby.</p>

        <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Prohibited Activities</h3>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use bots, scripts, or automated tools to play</li>
          <li>Exploit bugs, glitches, or vulnerabilities in the game</li>
          <li>Collude with other players to manipulate match outcomes</li>
          <li>Use multiple accounts to gain unfair advantages</li>
          <li>Attempt to interfere with other players' connections or gameplay</li>
          <li>Circumvent geographic restrictions using VPNs or other tools</li>
          <li>Engage in any form of cheating or unfair play</li>
          <li>Use the Service for money laundering or other illegal activities</li>
        </ul>
